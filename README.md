List children of the current content as links.

## Description 
The children-block provides two blocks

1. oik/children-block - to list children of the current content as links.
2. oik/parent-block - to display a link to the parent.

## Installation 

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/children-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

## Frequently Asked Questions 

# What are the values for the depth parameter? 

- Value - Meaning
- 0 - Display all descendents in a tree
- 1 - Display Children only
- 2 - Display Children and Grandchildren
- > 2 - Display more descendents
- -1 - Display all descendents in a list

# Why doesn't the parent block show multiple levels? 

That could be implemented using another block; a breadcrumbs block.
